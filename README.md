# Quantum-Game-Of-Life
Goals:

  Learn about quantum logic gates
  Learn how to use Qiskit, pygame, and StrangeWorks
  Create a simulator for Conway's Game of Life with elements of pseudo-randomness created using quantum algorithms
  Generate live cells that are clustered to create interesting effects.
  Upgrade generating code so that it generates well known figures with a higher-likelyhood
 
Achieved:

  Created a version of Conway's Game of Life that generates the board using classical and quantum computing
  Learned the math behind and how to use basic quantum gates: H, X, Z, CNOT, Ry, etc.
