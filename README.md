An implementaion of Conaway's Game of Life using randomness created using quantum

Inspired by:

https://beltoforion.de/en/recreational_mathematics/game_of_life.php

https://github.com/qonwaygameoflife/qonwaygameoflife # Only in concept

Goals:

  Learn about quantum logic gates

  Learn how to use Qiskit, pygame, and StrangeWorks

  Create a simulator for Conway's Game of Life with elements of pseudo-randomness created using quantum algorithms

  Generate live cells that are clustered to create interesting effects

  Upgrade generating code so that it generates well known figures with a higher-likelihood

 
Achieved:

  Created a version of Conway's Game of Life that generates the board using classical and quantum computing

  Learned the math behind and how to use basic quantum gates: H, X, Z, CNOT, Ry, etc.
