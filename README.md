# Quantum-Game-Of-Life

A demo for the game of life using quantum mechanics for the Qiskit 2021 Hackathon

## Goals

Learn about quantum logic gates

Learn how to use Qiskit, pygame, and StrangeWorks

Create a simulator for Conway's Game of Life with elements of pseudo-randomness created using quantum algorithms

Generate live cells that are clustered to create interesting effects

Upgrade generating code so that it generates well known figures with a higher-likelihood

## Achieved

Created a version of Conway's Game of Life that generates the board using classical and quantum computing

Learned the math behind and how to use basic quantum gates: H, X, Z, CNOT, Ry, etc.
